permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'Rhetorical devices are difficult to translate, but they are crucial to the translation of literary documents. We investigate the use of multilingual embedding spaces to characterize the preservation of intertextuality, one common rhetorical device, across human and machine translation. To do so, we use Biblical texts, which are both full of intertextual references and are highly translated works. We provide a metric to characterize intertextuality at the corpus level and provide a quantitative analysis of the preservation of this rhetorical device across extant human translations and machine-generated counterparts. We go on to provide qualitative analysis of cases wherein human translations over- or underemphasize the intertextuality present in the text, whereas machine translations provide a neutral baseline. This provides support for established scholarship proposing that human translators have a propensity to amplify certain literary characteristics of the original manuscripts.'
