Hope McGovern
=====

I am a second-year Computer Science PhD student and [Woolf Institute Scholar](https://www.woolf.cam.ac.uk/people/hope-mcgovern) at the University of Cambridge. Previously, I was a [Fulbright scholar](https://fulbrightscholars.org/) in Austria, applying deep learning to superresolution microscopy. I hold an MPhil with distinction in Computer Science from Cambridge, and a B.S. with honors in Engingeering Physics from Brown University.

My research interests lie in story understanding, natural language generation, and multilingual NLP. My PhD thesis focus is on structure-aware analysis of historical religious texts. I am looking for internships for Summer/Fall 2023.

I was recently a Research Scholar at the Summer Camp for Applied Language Exploration (SCALE) at the Johns Hopkins [Human Language Technology Center of Excellence](https://hltcoe.jhu.edu/). 

Beyond my life as a PhD student, I'm an avid reader, traveller, language learner, and musician.
